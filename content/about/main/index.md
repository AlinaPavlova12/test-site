  Currently, I am involved in the project titled “Developmental and Situational Dynamics of Students’ Emotions, Math Performance, and Well-Being.” My PhD project aims to investigate longitudinal patterns of students’ emotions, well-being, and math performance from 4th to 5th grade and trace emotional states as they arise during math problem-solving tasks using facial expression recognition analysis.
